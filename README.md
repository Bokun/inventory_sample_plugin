### Skeleton implementation for BÃ³kun's Inventory Service plugin.

This project should give you a head start if you are implementing Inventory Service plugin in Java.

Please [read the documentation](https://bokun.dev/implementing-inventory-service-plugin/rGmzgGe66zjtEQ8FUvS8dd/overview/ngZRtjHXMewiomPfARFDfZ) if you haven't done so.

This project includes necessary dependencies for grpc-generated API skeleton objects and gives a general impression on how we implement those plugins ourselves.

Requires Java 8.
